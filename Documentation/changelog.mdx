<Accordion title="August 2025 — Feature Rollouts, Enhancements & Bug Fixes" icon="wrench" defaultOpen>

**1. AI Interview Verdict Added to Reports**

A post-interview report is now generated for all AI interviews, clearly showing whether a candidate is

**"Recommended"** or **"Rejected."**

**2. AI Voice Not Audible in Recordings**

If the AI voice is not audible during screen sharing, please ensure that

**system audio sharing is enabled**. This resolves the issue.

**3. Human Interview Report Visibility Issue is Fixed**

Previously, when the **Human Interview** toggle was switched off, interview reports for candidates who had completed their human interview were not visible. This issue has now been **fixed**, and reports remain visible regardless of toggle changes.

**4. Meaning of "Not Available" Status**

The status **"Not Available"** in the interview report indicates that the system could not generate a verdict due to the **benchmark settings** configured on the job description page.

**5. Subtitles Support Added**

Subtitles are now available during AI interviews for both:

• **AI Voice**

• **AI Avatar**

This enhancement improves accessibility and clarity during the interview.

<Accordion title="September 2025 — What's New & What's Improved" icon="sparkles" defaultOpen>

**1. AI Interview Deadline Modification Process Clarified**

Recruiters requested guidance on updating AI interview deadlines for existing candidates.
A clear workflow has now been implemented:
**Job → Actions → Edit Job → Update Deadline**. 
Changes apply to all pending candidates.

**2. AI Interview Invite Threshold Configuration Added**

AI invites were being sent inconsistently.

The system now sends AI interview invites **only to candidates scoring above the benchmark threshold.**

This ensures improved quality control and candidate filtering.

**3. AI Interview Status Now Visible in Candidates Section**

The AI interview status was missing from the Candidates tab.

This has been addressed, and statuses are now fully visible in **Job Details → Candidates**.

**4. Bulk Parsing & AI Interview Sending Issues Fixed**

Users faced issues when sending AI interviews or uploading multiple files.

Enhancements include:

- Support for **docx, pdf, and text** files
- Bulk upload limit increased to **20 files**

These changes stabilize the interview sending workflow.

Organizers/recruiters were not receiving interview join links.

This issue has been fixed, organizers now consistently receive links for candidate coordination.
