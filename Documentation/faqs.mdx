<Accordion title="How do I add new questions?" icon="circle-plus" defaultOpen>

You can add new questions to your interview questionnaire in two ways:

**1. AI-Suggested Questions (Inline Editing)**

When Exterview generates a set of AI-suggested questions, you can edit any of them directly inline. This allows you to quickly refine or personalize the question before finalizing your questionnaire.

**2. Add Your Own Question**

On the top-right corner of the questions panel, you'll find the "Add Question" button.

Clicking this allows you to create a custom question from scratch, modify its structure, and fully tailor it to your job requirements
