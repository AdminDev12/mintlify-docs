Using the API Key
Once you have generated your API key, you need to include it in the header of each API request. The API key is passed in the header using the following format:

text
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
Example Request
Here is an example of how to include the API key in a cURL request:

bash
curl -X GET https://api.exterview.ai/interview \
-H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
Header Details
Header Name: x-api-key

Header Value: YOUR_API_KEY (Replace with the actual API key you generated from the client portal)

Error Handling
If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, the API will respond with an error. Below are common HTTP status codes related to authentication:

401 Unauthorized: The request was made without a valid API key or the key was incorrect.

403 Forbidden: The API key does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.

Example Error Response
json
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Unauthorized: API key is missing or invalid."
}
