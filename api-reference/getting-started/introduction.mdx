## Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability:

- **Default Limit**: 600 requests per minute per organization
- **Pagination**: Use `pageNum` and `perPage` for large datasets
- **Bulk Operations**: Recommended for high-volume operations

<Info>
Rate limit headers are included in every response to help you track your usage.
</Info>

## SDK & Libraries

While we don't provide official SDKs yet, our API is compatible with standard HTTP clients:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
// Using fetch API
const response = await fetch('https://api.exterview.ai/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': process.env.EXTERVIEW_API_KEY,
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.EXTERVIEW_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: '...' })
});
```

```python Python
# Using requests library
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.exterview.ai/graphql',
    headers={
        'x-api-key': os.getenv('EXTERVIEW_API_KEY'),
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("EXTERVIEW_TOKEN")}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={'query': '...'}
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.exterview.ai/graphql \
  -H "x-api-key: $EXTERVIEW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXTERVIEW_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "..."}'
```

    Always handle errors gracefully with proper retry logic and exponential backoff.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Paginate Large Results" icon="list">
    Use pagination for queries that return many results to optimize performance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Rate Limits" icon="gauge">
